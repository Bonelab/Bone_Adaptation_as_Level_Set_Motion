# QuadraticSurfaces
Below is code for creating quadratic surfaces.
Only three made the final publication, but the others are interesting none-the-less.

Assuming you have the appropriate conda environment activated, you can create all the surfaces with the following function:
```bash
bash create_surfaces.sh
```

Try chaning spacing and running Algorithm 1 ;)
