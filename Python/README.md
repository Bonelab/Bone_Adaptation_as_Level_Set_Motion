All Python code is supplied here.
These are mostly utility scripts.

See `QuadraticSurfaces` for how to create the quadratic surfaces.
The files provided are listed below.
- **visualize.py** Render the surface from phi
- **convertAim** Convert greyscale AIM data into NII
- **convertBinaryAim** Convert binary AIM data into NII

## Setup Environment
With `conda` installed, you can install all python dependancies using this command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml

You should now have an environemnt named `net` (bad name - feel free to change it) which you can run the code from.
Activate the environment using:
```bash
conda activate net
```
